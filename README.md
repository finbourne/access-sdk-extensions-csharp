![LUSID by Finbourne](https://content.finbourne.com/LUSID_repo.png)

These are the C# SDK Extensions to accompany the [C# SDK (Preview) for the Access application](https://github.com/finbourne/access-sdk-csharp-preview). The application provides access control for LUSID in conjunction with the [Identity](https://github.com/finbourne/identity-sdk-csharp-preview) application.

This extensions package provides the user with additional extensions to make it easy to configure and use the API endpoints. 

The Access application is part of the [LUSID by FINBOURNE](https://www.finbourne.com/lusid-technology) platform. To use it you'll need a LUSID account. [Sign up for free at lusid.com](https://www.lusid.com/app/signup).
